## OpenAI - `file_search`
https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search/quickstart#how-it-works

The `file_search` tool implements several retrieval best practices out of the box to help you extract the right data from your files and augment the model’s responses. The `file_search` tool:

- Rewrites user queries to optimize them for search.
- Breaks down complex user queries into multiple searches it can run in parallel.
- Runs both keyword and semantic searches across both assistant and thread vector stores.
- Reranks search results to pick the most relevant ones before generating the final response.

By default, the `file_search` tool uses the following settings but these can be configured to suit your needs:

- Chunk size: 800 tokens
- Chunk overlap: 400 tokens
- Embedding model: `text-embedding-3-large` at 256 dimensions
- Maximum number of chunks added to context: 20 (could be fewer)
- Ranker: `auto` (OpenAI will choose which ranker to use)
- Score threshold: 0 minimum ranking score
